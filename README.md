# LaTeX-misc
This is a repo for my LaTeX resources. I'll mostly be housing LaTeX document templates for anything I end up doing in this repository. 


## Template Theory Essay 
This folder includes documents needed for a template theory essay. There are a lot of files that aren't necessary to get started on a new project in that folder, so only extract the following: 
- main.tex
- turubian-formatting.sty
- turubian-researchpaper.cls
- works-cited.bib

The remaining documents are extra documents generated when I build the project. If you use something like Overleaf, you won't get documents like those. They're just here because I am running LaTeX from VSCode (there's probably some setting I don't know about that I should turn off). 

For a look at how this template works in the end, see `main.pdf`. 

The documents for this template are modified versions of a template found on Overleaf. If you'd like to see the original, see Omar Abdool's excellent [Turabian-formatted Research Paper][1] template.
